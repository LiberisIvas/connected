A group LAMP stack project with Mahmoud, Irene Mike and me: Ivas. 
The initial idea of the project borned after my participation in organizing event with 
people from art schools, circus people and instrument makers.  
This is the idea:
people with different creative disciplines can reach other to work on the projects, e.g.:
a film writer needs an actor or a sound boom operator for his film, so he can contact them via this forum 
and if everyone agrees they can unite and work on the project.
Project has 7 different disciplines where users are filtered accordingly:
"Eyes" - people working with visuals,
"Ears" - people working with sounds,
"Body" - a better example: actors or dancers,
"Head" - an example: script writers,
"Hands" - crafting people,
"Others" - other disciplined people.
Users can register, create their accounts, post their projects, send and get emails.
Project needs repolishing in logics and will be rebuild with MERN stack.
For now it is fully working in LAMP
